# Paper dataset from ICML, NIPS and ICLR

The dataset contains all paper titles, authors and their affiliations from the
years

- ICML: 2017-2018
- NIPS: 2016-2018
- ICLR: 2018

For NIPS you could in theory scrape the data since 2006 because that is when
they introduced their current web interface but for the other two that is all
this scraping script can do.
